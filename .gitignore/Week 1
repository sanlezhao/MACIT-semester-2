#master class 

today is the first day of the new semester. the class was about the introduction of simultaneous interpreting. 

i imagine simul woul;d be quite hard, as i suppose that slef monitor would be a big issue for me, and i definitely need to work on that. 

basically waht u need to do in consec interpreting, u also need to do them in simul mode.
except that in simul mode sth is more important and harder:

anticipation is crucial in simul 

paraphrasing is crucial. cut ur sentence into smaller pieces. but the sentence HAS TO BE COMPLETE SYTACTICALLY AND SEMEANTICALLY. 
in simultaneous interpreting. u do not divide a discourse in accordance with words/sentences. u divide it according to the MEANING.

split attention:
you need to ANALYZE & SELF MONITOR & PREDICT

intonation is more important in simul:
as the audience can't see u. u need to build some of the meaning into intonation (e.g. is the speaker sad? happy?)

when u do not know the official term of a word. creat a holding pattern for the term (i.e. other ways of expressing the meaning), hold it until u know the official and correcrt way of saying the word.

the time lag can't be too short. otherwise u will stop analyzing and anticipating and just pronouncing meaningless words. 

MAKE SURE THAT THE OUTPUT MAKES SENSE. put urslef in the shoes of ur audience. 

DO NOT translate the words of the speaker. convey the MEANING of the discourse.
